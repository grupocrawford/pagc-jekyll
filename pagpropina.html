  Our unique approach to bringing a mobile payments platform to Colombia starts with philanthropy. With our app coffee drinkers worldwide will be able to send a tip, or a propina in Spanish, directly to the farmer and laborers who brought the coffee from seed to cup. We are establishing pension accounts in a partnership with Colpensiones, a division of the Ministry of Labor, for the farmers and workers of Colombia. The pagPropina tip will be deposited directly into the pension accounts, which will provide compound returns in much the same way as the trees that continuously harvest coffee in Colombia all year-round. Inequities remain a sad reality in the coffee world. A single Arabica coffee tree can produce beans for up to 100 years, but the farmers and laborers in Colombia still struggle to feed their families from harvest to harvest. Our technology will disrupt the Fair Trade model and provide a self-sustaining alternative.

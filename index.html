        <h2>pagPropina</h2>
        <p>Our unique approach to bringing a mobile payments platform to Colombia starts with philanthropy. With our app coffee drinkers worldwide will be able to send a tip, or a propina in Spanish, directly to the farmer and laborers who brought the coffee from seed to cup. We are establishing pension accounts in a partnership with Colpensiones, a division of the Ministry of Labor, for the farmers and workers of Colombia. The pagPropina tip will be deposited directly into the pension accounts, which will provide compound returns in much the same way as the trees that continuously harvest coffee in Colombia all year-round. Inequities remain a sad reality in the coffee world. A single Arabica coffee tree can produce beans for up to 100 years, but the farmers and laborers in Colombia still struggle to feed their families from harvest to harvest. Our technology will disrupt the Fair Trade model and provide a self-sustaining alternative.</p>

        <h2>pagCafe</h2>
        <p>More than 80% of growers use mobile devices for WhatsApp, Facebook and video. Many have discovered the benefit of forward purchase agreements and electronic transfers, but a vast amount of transactions in the 3rd largest coffee producing nation in the world remains all cash. In many cases growers send samples to Bogot&aacute; only to wait weeks to know if their coffee has been sold and even longer to receive payment. As we speak, Colombian growers are being forced to sell beans well below their cost of production, exacerbating demands on working capital and perpetuating inequality. Our targeted payments platform will allow growers to promptly receive payment, manage inventory, control labor costs and lower their cost of production, which remains one of the most acute issues facing Colombian growers in the coffee crisis of 2019. Our partnerships with the 3rd largest coffee exporter in the world, one of the largest coffee farms in Colombia and many influential buyers in the United States and Europe provide a unique strategic advantage and short runway to scalability.</p>

        <h2>Café Colombiano</h2>
        <p>The beautiful biodiversity of Colombia creates one of the most fertile agricultural landscapes in the entire world. Surrounded by two oceans with vast volcanic mountains and sprawling rain forests, Colombia produces high quality, premium washed Arabica coffee all year round. The Andes Mountains divide the country into three parallel cordilleras, or mountain ranges. Conservation International has dubbed Colombia the “richest and most diverse region on Earth,” citing that it holds one sixth of the world’s plant species on only one percent of its total land area. For more on Colombian Coffee we guide you to visit the information provided by our partners, the third largest coffee exporter in the world, Volcafe and one of the largest coffee farms and ecotourism businesses in Colombia, Hacienda Venecia.

        <h2>Colpensiones</h2>
        <p>Colpensiones is an industrial and commercial state-funded institution that is linked to the Ministry of Labor to administer pension accounts. The institution replaced the sixty year old Instituto de Seguros Sociales. The group aims to “Think Big,” and we are proud to provide a technology platform that allows them to do just that in providing a future for the farmers and laborers of Colombia. Retirement savings in Colombia is very low despite the requirement that 16% of an employee’s salary be deposited in either a public defined-benefit or private defined-contribution retirement plan. In fact, 13% of the public pensioners and 25% of the private pensioners are NOT expected to reach the minimum savings necessary to receive pension disbursements upon retirement. Our partnership with Colpensiones, in conjunction with the highly anticipated launch of pagPropina, allows coffee drinkers worldwide to fund pensions for millions of growers and laborers in South America. They will learn to harvest their financial future as they manage payments for their businesses in the present.</p>

        <h2><strong>Mission</strong></h2>
        <p>Our passion for coffee and the people of Colombia drives our desire to make the coffee producing world a better place. Our goal is not only to disrupt the fragmented global supply chain, but also to reimagine the flawed concept of Fair Trade coffee. With technology, creativity and philanthropy, we can provide a sustainable solution that will cultivate a better quality of life for the growers and laborers of Colombia. Our model will not only sustain the producing countries, but also add value to others along the value chain as we unlock information and provide a comprehensive value-added approach. Private enterprise should lead the way in making the world a better place. Through PagPropina, Cosecha and eventually, the Grupo Crawford Cafetero Fund, we will plant the seeds for a long-lasting, sustainable alternative to Fair Trade coffee.</p>

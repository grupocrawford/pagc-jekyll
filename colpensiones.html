    Colpensiones is an industrial and commercial state-funded institution that is linked to the Ministry of Labor to administer pension accounts. The institution replaced the sixty year old Instituto de Seguros Sociales. The group aims to “Think Big,” and we are proud to provide a technology platform that allows them to do just that in providing a future for the farmers and laborers of Colombia. Retirement savings in Colombia is very low despite the requirement that 16% of an employee’s salary be deposited in either a public defined-benefit or private defined-contribution retirement plan. In fact, 13% of the public pensioners and 25% of the private pensioners are NOT expected to reach the minimum savings necessary to receive pension disbursements upon retirement. Our partnership with Colpensiones, in conjunction with the highly anticipated launch of pagPropina, allows coffee drinkers worldwide to fund pensions for millions of growers and laborers in South America. They will learn to harvest their financial future as they manage payments for their businesses in the present.

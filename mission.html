    More than 80% of growers use mobile devices for WhatsApp, Facebook and video. Many have discovered the benefit of forward purchase agreements and electronic transfers, but a vast amount of transactions in the 3rd largest coffee producing nation in the world remains all cash. In many cases growers send samples to Bogotá only to wait weeks to know if their coffee has been sold and even longer to receive payment. As we speak, Colombian growers are being forced to sell beans well below their cost of production, exacerbating demands on working capital and perpetuating inequality. Our targeted payments platform will allow growers to promptly receive payment, manage inventory, control labor costs and lower their cost of production, which remains one of the most acute issues facing Colombian growers in the coffee crisis of 2019. Our partnerships with the 3rd largest coffee exporter in the world, one of the largest coffee farms in Colombia and many influential buyers in the United States and Europe provide a unique strategic advantage and short runway to scalability.

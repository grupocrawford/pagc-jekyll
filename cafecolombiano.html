        The beautiful biodiversity of Colombia creates one of the most fertile
        agricultural landscapes in the entire world. Surrounded by two oceans with
        vast volcanic mountains and sprawling rain forests, Colombia produces high
        quality, premium washed Arabica coffee all year round. The Andes Mountains
        divide the country into three parallel cordilleras, or mountain ranges.
        Conservation International has dubbed Colombia the “richest and most diverse
        region on Earth,” citing that it holds one sixth of the world’s plant
        species on only one percent of its total land area. For more on Colombian
        Coffee we guide you to visit the information provided by our partners, the
        third largest coffee exporter in the world,

        coffee farms and ecotourism businesses in Colombia,

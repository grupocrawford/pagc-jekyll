    The beautiful biodiversity of Colombia creates one of the most fertile agricultural landscapes in the entire world. Surrounded by two oceans with vast volcanic mountains and sprawling rain forests, Colombia produces high quality, premium washed Arabica coffee all year round. The Andes Mountains divide the country into three parallel cordilleras, or mountain ranges. Conservation International has dubbed Colombia the “richest and most diverse region on Earth,” citing that it holds one sixth of the world’s plant species on only one percent of its total land area. For more on Colombian Coffee we guide you to visit the information provided by our partners, the third largest coffee exporter in the world, Volcafe and one of the largest coffee farms and ecotourism businesses in Colombia, Hacienda Venecia.
